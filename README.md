Blue Collar Dollar

Your money, your way

The purpose of this project is to develop and establish a public facing, supernational financial instrument which allows for the financial freedom of Lawful-Private-Individuals around the world,
safeguard and prevent criminalities from being perpetrated against them and positively impact the lives of the people and communities around each of us.

The operating premise of this project is that there is now and will always be common threads which tie all of humanity together.
Regardless if you're driving truck in the heartland of America or ranching in Austrailia, drilling for oil in Saudi Arabia or cutting timber in Russia.
Regardless if you're a shop keeper in South Africa of fishing in the Philippines, We all have the pride and dignity of our profession that ties each of us to the world we live in.

Family and community are the driving forces behind our daily efforts and labors.
Most of the time, those efforts and labors are performed alone, where nobody will see the hard work.
Reccognition only comes from the products we create once our labors are finished.
The Basic-Human-Right and Priviledge of providing a better life for the people we love is the one Valuable-Treasure which nobody should ever have to sacrifice

The Blue-Collar-Dollar project is a collective voice on the world stage which stands for these private and extremely personal values of humanity and safeguarding all life.
Each of us contribute to our greater community. When financial storms loom dark overhead, as well as real-world storms, life can seem uncertain.
We are the ones who head into the storm to find a way in that darkest hour.
We don't do this for glory or recognition, we do this because that is simply who we are. We go out to bring home that payload.
We bring it back home for everyone around us to live successful lives.
We are everywhere. All over the world.

The Blue-Collar-Dollar project is built as a constructive solution for private individuals to prevent unwanted systemic financial events in our neighborhoods and around the world.
Not simply today, for time immmemorial.

Storms, financial and real-world, will always persist in life. there will come another emergency.
There will always be another reason we make that choice to get out there in this world and be the difference we wish to see in this world of ours.
That daily choice belongs to each of us.

We are a product of our past and the authors of our future. We are living a mere snapshot in time called the: Now-Space.
We literally hold the world in our hands every single day.
Throughout history, our laborers, explorers and soldiers from all over the world have paid the ultimate price for the advancement and betterment of our global civilizations
In our future, generations of laborers, explorers and soldiers will gladly continue to pay this same ultimate price and further our cause to live, free from oppresion, free from hunger, free from political war-games.
We choose to live in a world of abundance, we make the world abundant with our own efforts.
We provide the best life possible for our loved ones, our communities and ourselves by simply making the daily decision, not to be fearful when the storms of life are dark and scary.

In the majority of time, we don't search out overarching circles of influence.
We don't strive for power or political gain.
We are the silent majority.
We know the real value of hard work.
We know the power that lives within the people.
We know who we are, we are everywhere and we are not going away.

Many attempts around the world have been made for centuries to bypass global financial controls, these attempts were designed to harvest "profit" from the efforts of real-world people around the world like a type of cash-crop.
Through the centuries, there has come a decided "game" at play to maintain control over the masses, in order to make profit from the efforts of: Real-World-People.
There exists no law, no rule or policy to this "game" which cannot be changed or secretly broken for the benefit of the few corrupt "bad-actor" who are willing sacrifice anything and anyone in order to get what they want.

If somehow, the people gain a point of advantage in this game, the governing laws and policies are simply changed to keep those people under a "great-thumb" of oppresion called jurisdiction.
Now, we have an opportunity to live our lives, free from this game of oppresion, The great-jurisdictional-game.
Our opportunity is "written in the stars".
There is a new frontier for money and finance which is emerging.
The age of technology is upon us and the new frontier is being developed with or without us.
Life is not always easy, we will overcome. Our opportunity and the choices in our lives come from within ourselves.
This opportunity comes from our own comprehension of this digital age.
It is time to gather our trusted, traditional tools and get to work with these new tool to build our collective future, together.

This type of opportunity comes only once in a lifetime for some, and not at all for others.
We choose to be the force that causes our brave new world to thrive in abundance.
We meerly have need to grasp the nature of the world and act upon our comprehension.

There is one dark truth, of which we all must wrestle with moving forward: We have all been lied to, by ommision, for our entire lives regarding the nature of money and the world of finance.
We have been trained by the people who lied to us to expect a life of scarcity, and to simply surrender that which they most value... our time in this world, as well as other precious things.
The masses of people have been successfully trained to expect to get only the "leftovers" as their share of the bounty of their work.
This, coincidentally, seems to be just enough to survive but never thrive.
As if the financial system were designed that way intentionally. IT WAS!!!
Not anymore!!!

More specifically, many on-line schemes have been developed in pursuit of pulling-in monitary profit for personal gain.
Many plans and/or business models have been built to drive passive income for said personal gain without regard to the greater world they too live in.
These plans and business models all fall short of the goal to bring humanity into a golden-age for prosperity.
This declares the simple truth: The control mechanisms which keep us all under financial control cannot be escaped on a personal level.
The solution can ONLY be a systemic solution for all of humanity to exist in a level-playing-field of opportunity.
No ammount of personal success will allow society to be elevated to the point of escpae from this world-wide game of jurisdictional oppression.
True freedom MUST be accomplished on a systemic level with both new tools and old tools.

This project is designed, not for my own personal gain.
Even though private gain will come to pass by virtue of this project and others like it, this project is not for personal profits.
The Blue-Collar-Dollar project is developed for the advancement of the very idea of: what money represents to us all,
as well as what the use of the right form of money can do for our lives and for our loved ones and communities for generations to come.
Changing the global mind-set of finance is the single obsticle remaining for the success of the human race.

Finding the strength to push forward in life and in this project to develop real solutions for our daily lives is not only what we do, it is who we are.
As we find ourselves with comprehension and refreshed energies to rebuild the world in our own image, we do this with our own designs, our own methods and by using our own values.
Our opportunity is a derivative of digital money and digitizing finance, both traditional and alternative.

By utilizing Blue-Collar-Dollar, your money holds real value that remains under your care, custody and control.
The people taking control of this opportunity will assuredly launch the real-world into a new system of finance.
The Blue-Collar-Dollar is this opportunity to own and control your own destiny, your own future, your own dreams.
A life of prosperity awaits us all, we simply need to reach out and take it for ourselves.
